# Totally Normal Dash

Geometry Dash but normal.

<cr>THIS MOD IS CHEATING, PROGRESS WON'T SAVE WHEN USING THIS MOD</c>

- Key switching in level
- Minecraft commands and F3
- Sprinting and stamina
- Critical Jumps
- Draggable ship

Everything is provided as is, bug reports are welcome on the GitHub issues page.

Mobile and Mac not supported, makes GD normal in ways that mobile and mac cannot handle.



Sprinting does not work in the editor due to key conflicts
Sprinting is disabled in platformer by default as there are some strange bugs I haven't figured out how to fix with inputs.
Keyboard Pro does not work in practice mode yet
